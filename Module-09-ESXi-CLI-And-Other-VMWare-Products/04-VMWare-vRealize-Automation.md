# VMware vRealize Automation (vRA)

## Overview

VMware vRealize Automation (vRA) is a cloud automation and self-service provisioning platform for VMware environments.

It allows users to request and deploy virtual machines and services automatically through a self-service portal.

vRA is designed for:

- Private cloud
- Hybrid cloud
- Multi-cloud environments

---

## What vRA Does

vRealize Automation provides:

- Self-service VM provisioning
- Automated infrastructure deployment
- Policy-based governance
- Approval workflows
- Multi-cloud support

It transforms traditional virtualization into a cloud-like experience.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Self-Service Portal

Users can:

- Request VMs
- Select OS templates
- Choose CPU, RAM, and storage
- Deploy applications

All through a web interface.

---

### 2. Blueprints (Cloud Templates)

Administrators define infrastructure using:

- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)
- YAML-based cloud templates
- Predefined VM configurations

This ensures consistent deployments.

---

### 3. Automation & Workflows

- Automatic VM provisioning
- Network configuration
- Storage assignment
- Post-deployment scripting

Integrates with other tools and APIs.

---

### 4. Policy & Governance

- Resource quotas
- Approval policies
- Lease time management
- Cost tracking

Helps control resource usage.

---

### 5. Multi-Cloud Integration

Supports:

- VMware vSphere
- VMware Cloud
- AWS
- Azure
- Google Cloud (depending on version)

Allows unified management across platforms.

---

## How It Works

1. vRA connects to vCenter.
2. Admins create blueprints/templates.
3. Users request resources from portal.
4. System automatically deploys infrastructure.
5. Policies and approvals are enforced.

## vRA vs vCenter

| vCenter | vRealize Automation |
|----------|----------------------|
| Manual VM creation | Automated self-service provisioning |
| Admin-driven | User-driven with policies |
| Basic management | Full cloud automation |
| Infrastructure control | Infrastructure orchestration |

vRA builds on top of vCenter.

---

## Benefits

- Faster provisioning
- Reduced manual work
- Standardized deployments
- Improved governance
- Cloud-like user experience

---

## Summary

VMware vRealize Automation is a cloud automation platform that enables self-service provisioning, policy control, and infrastructure automation. It helps organizations move from traditional virtualization to private or hybrid cloud environments.
