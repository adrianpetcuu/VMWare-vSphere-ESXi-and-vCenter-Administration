# IT Components

Information Technology (IT) infrastructure is built from multiple components that work together to deliver computing services.

At the foundation level, hardware provides the physical resources required to run systems.

Servers are powerful computers designed to deliver services such as applications, databases, file storage, and web hosting.

Workstations are end-user systems used for productivity tasks.

Networking equipment connects devices and enables communication between systems.

Switches connect devices within the same local network.

Routers connect different networks and manage traffic between them.

Firewalls provide security by controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

Storage systems are used to store and protect data.

Common storage types include local disks, NAS, SAN, and cloud storage.

Operating systems manage hardware and provide an interface for applications.

Examples include Windows Server and Linux distributions.

Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical server.

Hypervisors such as VMware ESXi manage virtual machines.

Virtual machines contain their own OS, CPU allocation, memory, and disk.

vCenter provides centralized management of multiple hosts.

Datastores store virtual machine files and disk images.

Clusters group multiple hosts for resource sharing and availability.

High Availability ensures automatic VM restart during host failure.

Distributed Resource Scheduler balances workloads across hosts.

Fault Tolerance provides zero-downtime protection for critical VMs.

Networking components include VLANs, virtual switches, and distributed switches.

IP addressing enables communication between systems.

DNS translates domain names into IP addresses.

DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.

Authentication systems manage user access and identity.

Active Directory is commonly used for centralized authentication.

Backup systems protect data from loss or corruption.

Monitoring tools track performance and health of systems.

Logging systems record events for troubleshooting and auditing.

Cloud platforms extend infrastructure beyond on-premises environments.

Automation tools reduce manual configuration tasks.

Security tools protect systems from malware and cyber threats.

Encryption protects sensitive data during transmission and storage.

Load balancers distribute traffic across multiple servers.

Databases store structured application data.

Web servers host websites and web applications.

Application servers run business logic and services.

Containers provide lightweight application virtualization.

Orchestration platforms manage containers at scale.

Disaster recovery solutions ensure business continuity.

Power systems such as UPS protect against outages.

Cooling systems maintain optimal operating temperatures.

Documentation and policies define operational procedures.

IT infrastructure combines hardware, software, networking, storage, and security components to deliver reliable, scalable, and secure computing services.
